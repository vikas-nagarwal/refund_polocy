      <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>

      <h2>Cancellation Window</h2>
      <p>
        Users can cancel their service or subscription within a specified period
        (e.g., 24 hours) from the time of purchase for a full refund.
        Cancellations made after this period may not be eligible for a refund.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Request</h2>
      <p>
        To request a refund, users must submit a formal request through the
        designated process on our platform. The request should include
        transaction details, a valid reason for cancellation, and any supporting
        documentation as required.
      </p>

      <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds are applicable only if the service is canceled before the start
        of any associated cricket event or service. If the event or service has
        commenced, cancellations may not be eligible for a refund.
      </p>

      <h2>Processing Time</h2>
      <p>
        Once a refund request is approved, refunds will be processed within a
        specified timeframe (e.g., 7-10 business days). Users will receive a
        notification once their refund has been processed.
      </p>

      <h2>Payment Method</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the
        transaction. Users should ensure that the payment method is active and
        able to receive refunds.
